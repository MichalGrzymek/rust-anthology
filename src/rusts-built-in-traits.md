# Rust's Built-in Traits, the When, How & Why

As the title not quite subtly hints, today I'm going to write about the
*traits* that come with [Rust](http://rust-lang.org)'s standard library,
specifically from the context of a library writer yearning to give their users
a good experience.

Note that I define built-in as "came with the box that you downloaded Rust
in". This includes traits that have no special language semantics.

Rust uses traits for a good number of things, from the quite obvious operator
overloading to the very subtle like `Send` and `Sync`. Some traits can be
*auto-derived* (which means you can just write 
`#[derive(Copy, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Debug, Default, Hash, …)]` and get a
magically appearing implementation that usually does the right thing. with
Send and Sync, you actually have to actively opt out of implementing them.

So I'll try to go from the obvious and specific to the nebulous and (perhaps) 
surprising:

### (Partial)–Eq/Ord

[`PartialEq`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html) defines
partial equality. This means the relation is
[symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_relation) (`a == b` →
`b == a` for all `a` and `b` of the respective type) and
[transitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_relation) (`a == b`
∧ `b == c` → `a == c` for all `a`, `b` and `c` of the type).

[`Eq`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Eq.html) is used as a marker to
declare that `PartialEq` is also
[reflexive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexive_relation) (`a == a` for
all `a` of the respective type). Counter-Example: The `f32` and `f64` types
implement `PartialEq`, but not `Eq`, because `NAN != NAN`.

It is useful to implement both traits, for a good number of `std`'s types use
them as trait bounds for one thing or another, e.g. `Vec`'s `dedup()` function.
Auto-deriving `PartialEq` will make the `eq`-method check equality of all parts
of your type (e.g. for `struct`s, all parts will be checked, while for `enum`
types, the variant along with all its contents is checked).

Since `Eq` is basically empty (apart from a
[pre-defined marker method](http://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/cmp.rs.html#81)
that is used by the auto-deriving logic to ensure that it actually worked and
probably shouldn't be used anywhere else), auto-deriving has no chance of doing
something interesting, so it won't.

[`PartialOrd`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html) defines 
a partial order, and extends the equality of `PartialEq` by the 
[`Ordering`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/enum.Ordering.html) relation.
Partial in this case means there may be instances of your type that cannot be
meaningfully compared.

[`Ord`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) requires a full order 
relation. In contrast to `PartialEq`/`Eq`, those two traits actually have a 
different interface (the `partial_cmp(…)` method returns `Option<Ordering>`, so 
it can return `None` for incomparable instances, while `Ord`'s `cmp(…)` returns 
the `Ordering` directly), and their only relation is that if you wish to 
implement `Ord`, you have to implement `PartialOrd` as well, for the latter is 
a trait bound for the former.

Auto-deriving both will order structs 
[lexicographically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order), enums 
by the appearance of the variant in the definition (unless you define values 
for the variants).

Should you opt to implement the relation manually, be careful to ensure a stable
result that follows the rules of ordering relations, lest your program break in
confusing ways.

The order imposed by (`Partial`)`Ord` is used for the `<`, `<=`, `=>` and `>`
operators.

### Arithmetic Operators

The following table shows the relation between arithmetic operators and traits:

Operator|Trait
--------|-----
`a + b` |[`Add`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Add.html)
`a - b` |[`Sub`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Sub.html)
`-a`    |[`Neg`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Neg.html)
`a * b` |[`Mul`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Mul.html)
`a / b` |[`Div`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Div.html)
`a % b` |[`Rem`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Rem.html)

Apart from [`Rem`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Rem.html), which is 
an abbreviation for *Remainder*, also  known as `mod` in some other languages, 
those are pretty obvious. The binary operator traits all have a `RHS` 
(=right-hand-side) generic type bound which defaults to `Self`, as well as an 
associated `Output` type that the implementation has to declare.

This means you can implement e.g. addition of a `Foo` and a `Bar` to return a 
`Baz` if you so desire. Note that while the operations do not constrain their 
semantics in any way, it is strongly advisable not to make them mean something 
entirely different than their arithmetical counterparts shown above, lest your 
implementation become a 
[footgun](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=footgun) for other 
developers.

Aside: Just before Rust 1.0.0, someone actually implemented `Add` for `String`
and `Vec` to mean concatenation. It took yours truly (among others) a 
heartrending plea to the Rust gods until they mended this particular error at
least for `Vec`. This means that you can write `my_string + " etc."` as long
as `my_string` is a `String` – note that this will actually consume 
`my_string` by value, which may be confusing to some.

### Bit-Operators

The following operators are defined to be used bitwise. Note that unlike the 
`!`-operator, the short-circuiting `&&` and `||` cannot be overloaded – because 
this would require them to avoid eagerly evaluating their arguments, which 
isn't easily possible in Rust – and even if it were possible, e.g. using 
closures as a workaround, it would just be confusing other developers.

Operator|Trait
--------|-----
`!a`    |[`Not`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Not.html)
`a & b` |[`BitAnd`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.BitAnd.html)
`a \| b` |[`BitOr`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.BitOr.html)
`a ^ b` |[`BitXor`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.BitXor.html)
`a << b`|[`Shl`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Shl.html)
`a >> b`|[`Shr`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Shr.html)

Like with all operators, be wary of implementing those for your type unless you 
have specific reason to, e.g. it may make sense to define some of them on 
`BitSet`s (which by the way are no longer part of the standard library as of 
Rust 1.3.0) or on types representing large integers.

### Index and IndexMut

The [`Index`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html) and 
[`IndexMut`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.IndexMut.html) traits 
specify the indexing operation with immutable and mutable results. The former 
is read-only, while the latter allows both assigning and mutating the value, 
that is calling a function that takes a `&mut` argument (note that this may, 
but need not be self).

You will most likely want to implement them with any sort of collection 
classes. Apart from those, use of those traits would be a 
[footgun](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=footgun) anyway.

### Fn, FnMut and FnOnce

the `Fn*`-traits abstract the act of calling something. The difference between 
those traits is simply how the `self` is taken: 
[`Fn`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html) takes it by reference, 
[`FnMut`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html) by mutable 
reference and [`FnOnce`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html) 
consumes it by value (which is after all why it can only be called once, as 
there is no `self` to call afterwards).

Note that this distinction is just about `self`, not any of the other 
arguments. It is perfectly fine to call a `Fn` with mutably referenced or even
owned/moved arguments.

The traits are auto-derived for functions and closures and I have yet to see
a different case where they are useful. stebalien also points out that they
actually *cannot* be implemented in stable Rust.

### Display and Debug

[`Display`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Display.html) and 
[`Debug`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Debug.html) are used for 
formatting values. The former is meant to produce user-facing output and as 
such cannot be auto-derived, while the latter will usually produce a JSON-like 
representation of your type and can safely be auto-derived for most types.

Should you decide to implement `Debug` manually, you may want to distinguish
between the normal `{:?}` format specifier and the pretty-printing `{:#?}` one.
The easiest way to do this is to use the Debug Builder method. The 
[`Formatter`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/struct.Formatter.html) type has
some (unfortunately unstable as of yet, but soon to be stabilized) very helpful
methods, look for `debug_struct(&mut self, &str)`, 
`debug_tuple(&mut self, &str)`, etc.

Otherwise you can do this by querying the `Formatter::flags()` method, which 
will have the `4` bit set (which I found out by 
[experiment](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=f9024a36b7e0e61c1ce7&version=stable)). 
Thus, if `(f.flags() & 4) == 4` is `true`, the caller asked you to produce 
pretty-printed output. Note that this is expressly *not* a public part of 
`Debug`/`Formatter`'s interface, so the Rust gods could change this the moment 
I write this.

Seriously, if you can help it, use auto-derived `Debug` or debug builders.

Aside: It's not very common, but there may be cyclic object graphs in Rust, 
which would send the debug logic into infinite recursion (well, usually the 
application will crash with a stack overflow). In most cases, this is 
acceptable, because cycles *are* quite uncommon. In case you suspect your 
type to form cycles more often than average, you may want to do something 
about it.

### Copy and Clone

Those two traits take care of duplicating objects.

[`Copy`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) declares that 
your type can be safely copied. This means that if you copy the memory a value 
of your type resides in, you get a new valid value that has no references to 
data of the original. It can be auto-derived (and requires 
[`Clone`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html), because all 
`Copy`able types are also `Clone`able by definition). In fact there is no use 
in implementing it manually anywhere.

There are exactly three reasons *not* to implement `Copy`: 

1. Your type cannot be `Copy`able, because it contains mutable references
   or implements `Drop`.
2. <s>Your type is so big that copying it would be prohibitively expensive (e.g. 
   it could contain an `[f64; 65536]`)</s> Rust Guru eddyb notes that Rust
   would still copy the whole thing unless you work with references.
3. You actually want *move semantics* for your type

The third reason should be explained further. By default, Rust has *move* 
semantics – if you assign a value from `a` to `b`, `a` no longer holds the 
value. However, for types that have a `Copy` implementation, the value is 
actually copied (unless the original value is no longer used, in which case 
LLVM *may* elide the copy to improve performance). The 
[docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html) for `Copy` go into
more detail.

[`Clone`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html) is a more 
generic solution that will take care of any references. You will probably want 
to auto-derive it in most cases (as being able to clone values is rather 
useful), and only implement it manually for things like custom refcounting 
schemes, garbage collection or something similar.

In contrast to `Copy` which actually alters assignment semantics, `Clone` is 
explicit: It defines the `.clone()` method which you have to call manually to 
clone something.

### Drop

The [`Drop`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) trait is about 
giving back resources when things go out of scope. Much has been written about 
it, and how you shouldn't rely on it being called should something go wrong. 
Still, it's very nice especially for wrapping FFI constructs that have to 
somehow be reclaimed later, also it's used on files, sockets, database handles 
and the kitchen sink.

Unless you have an instance where this applies, you should refrain from 
implementing `Drop` at all – your values will be `Drop`ped correctly by default
anyway. A (temporary) exception is to insert some tracing output to find out
when a specific value has been dropped.

### Default

[`Default`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html) is a trait 
to declare a default value for your type. It can be auto-derived, but *only* 
for `struct`s whose members all have a `Default` implementations.

It is implemented for a great many types in the standard libraries, and also
used in a surprising number of places. So if your type has a value that can
be construed as being "default", it is a good idea to implement this trait.

A great thing with `struct`s that have a `Default` implementation, is you can
instantiate them with only the non-default values like:

```rust,ignore
let x = Foo { bar: baz, ..Default::default() }
```

and have all other fourtytwo fields of Foo be filled with default values. How
cool is that? Honestly, the only single reason not to have `Default` is if 
your type has no single value that works as a default.

### Error

[`Error`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/error/trait.Error.html) is a base trait 
for all values representing an error in Rust. For those coming from Java, it is 
akin to `Throwable` – and behaves similarly (apart from the fact that we 
neither `catch` nor `throw` them).

It is a *very* good idea to implement `Error` for any type you intend to use in 
the latter part of 
[`Result`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html). Doing so will 
make your functions *much* more composable, especially when you can simply 
[`Box`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) the Error as a 
trait object.

Look at the 
[Using `try!`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/error-handling.html#using-try!) 
section of the Rust book for further information.

### Hash

Hashing is the process of reducing a bag of data into a single value that still
distinguishes different data items while returning the same value for equal 
items without requiring as much bits as the processed data.

In Rust, the [`Hash`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hash.html) trait 
denotes values to which this process can be applied. Note that this trait does 
not relate any information about the hash *algorithm* used (this is 
encapsulated within the 
[`Hasher`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html) trait), it 
basically just orders the bits to be hashed.

Aside: This is also the reason why 
[`HashMap`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) does 
not implement `Hash` itself, because two equal hash maps could still store 
their contents in different order, resulting in different hashes, which would 
break the hashing contract. Even if the items were ordered (see `Ord` above), 
hashing them would require sorting, which would be too expensive to be useful.
One could also xor the entry hash values, but that would require re-using the
`Hasher`, which would at least require a `Clone` bound, which the interface
lacks. In any event, use a 
[`BTreeMap`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html) 
as key for your maps if you must have maps as keys to a hashmap. In that case,
you should probably also be thinking about a career change.

Unless you have some very specific constraints regarding equality, you can 
safely auto-derive `Hash`. Should you choose to implement it manually, be 
careful not to break its contract, lest your programs fail in surprising and
hard to debug ways.

### Iterator and Friends

Rust's `for` loops work can iterate over everything that implements 
[`IntoIterator`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html). 
Yes, that includes 
[`Iterator`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html) itself. 
Apart from that, the `Iterator` trait has a lot of cool methods for working 
with the iterated values, like `filter`, `map`, `enumerate`, `fold`, `any`, 
`all`, `sum`, `min` and much more.

Did I tell you I love iterators? If your type contains more than one value of
something, and it makes sense to do the same thing to all of them, consider
providing an `Iterator` over them just in case. :-)

Implementing `Iterator` is actually pretty easy – you just need to declare the
`Item` type and write the `next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>` method. This
method should return `Some(value)` as long as you have values, then return 
`None` to stop the iteration.

Note that if you have a *slice* of values (or an array or vec, from which you
can *borrow* a slice), you can get its iterator directly, so you don't even
need to implement it yourself. This may not be as cool as auto-deriving, but
it's nice nonetheless.

While writing [optional](https://github.com/llogiq/optional), I found that 
using a const slice's iterator is faster in the boolean case, but creating a 
slice of the value is still slower than copying it for most values. Your 
mileage may vary.

### From, Into and Various Variations

I said it before, whoever designed the 
[`From`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.From.html) and 
[`Into`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html) traits is a 
genius. They abstract over *conversions* between types (which are used quite
often) and allow library authors to make their libraries much more
interoperable, e.g. by using `Into<T>` instead of `T` as arguments.

For obvious reasons, those traits cannot be auto-derived, but writing them
should be trivial in most cases. If you choose to implement them – and you
should wherever you find a worthwhile conversion! – implement `From` wherever
possible, and failing that implement `Into`.

Why? There is a blanket implementation of `Into<U>` for `T` where `U: From<T>`.
This means if you have implemented `From`, you get an `Into` delivered to your
home free of charge.

Why not implement `From` everywhere? The orphan rule unfortunately forbids
implementing `From` for types not defined in other crates. For example, I have
an `Optioned<T>` type, that I may want to convert into an
[`Option<T>`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html). Trying to 
implement `From`:

```rust,ignore
impl<T: Noned + Copy> From<Optioned<T>> for Option<T> {
	#[inline]
	fn from(self) -> Option<T> { self.map_or_else(|| none(), wrap) }
}
```

I get an error: type parameter `T` must be used as the type parameter for some 
local type (e.g. `MyStruct<T>`); only traits defined in the current crate can 
be implemented for a type parameter `[E0210]`

Note that you can implement `From` and `Into` with multiple classes, you can
have a `From<Foo>` and a `From<Bar>` for the same type.

There are a good number of traits starting with `Into` – `IntoIterator`, which
is stable and which we already have discussed above, just being one of them.
There also is
[`FromIterator`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.FromIterator.html),
which does the reverse, namely constructing a value of your type from an
iterator of items.

Then there is [`FromStr`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html)
for any types that can be parsed from a string, which is very useful for types
that you want read from any textual source, e.g. configuration or user input.
Note that its interface differs from `From<&str>` in that it returns a
`Result`, and thus allows to relate parsing errors to the caller.

### Deref(Mut), AsRef/AsMut, Borrow(Mut) and ToOwned

Those all have to do with references and borrowing, so I grouped them into one
section.

The prefix-`*`-operator *dereferences* a reference, producing the value. This 
is directly represented by the
[`Deref`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html) trait; if we
require a mutable value (e.g. to assign somehing or call a mutating function), 
we invoke the
[`DerefMut`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html) trait.

Note that this does not necessarily mean *consuming* the value – maybe we take 
a reference to it in the same expression, e.g. `&*x` (which you will likely 
find in code that deals with special kinds of pointers, e.g. `syntax::ptr::P` 
is widely used in [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) and 
other lints / compiler plugins. Perhaps `as_ref()` would be clearer in those 
cases (see below), but here we are.

The `Deref` trait has but one method: `fn deref(&'a self) -> &'a Self::Target;`
where `Target` is an associated type of the trait. The lifetime bound on the
result requires that the returned value live as long as self. This requirement
restricts the possible implementation strategies to two options:

1. Dereference to a value *within* your type, e.g. if you have a
`struct Foo { b: Bar }`, you could dereference to `Bar`. Note that this doesn't
mean you *should* do it, but it's possible and may in some cases be useful.
This obviously works as long as the part's lifetime is the one of the whole,
which is the default with Rust's lifetime elision.

2. Dereference to a constant `'static` value – I
[do this](https://github.com/llogiq/optional/blob/db2b4c742e41f4607e64b9e855ae4638d839e828/src/lib.rs#L76) 
in optional to have `OptionBool` dereference to a const `Option<bool>`. This
works because the result is guaranteed to outlive our value, because it is
alive for the rest of the program. This is only useful if you have a finite
value domain. Even then, it is probably clearer to use
[`Into`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.Into.html) instead of
`Deref`. I doubt that we will see this too often.

[`DerefMut`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html) only has the
former strategy. Its usefulness is limited to implementing special kinds of
pointers.

To see why no other implementation can be possible, let's make a thought
experiment: If we had a return value that is neither static, nor bound to the
lifetime `'a` of our dereferenced value, it would by definition have a lifetime
`'b` that is *distinct* from `'a`. There is no way we could unify those two
lifetimes – QED.

As for the other traits, they exist mainly to abstract away the act of
borrowing / referencing for some types (because e.g. with `Vec`s it is possible
to borrow a slice of them). As such, they fall into the same category as the
`From`/`Into` traits – they don't get invoked behind the scenes, but exist to
make some interfaces more adaptable.

The relation between
[`Borrow`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html), 
[`AsRef`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html)/[`AsMut`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/convert/trait.AsMut.html) 
and [`ToOwned`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html) is as 
follows:

From↓ / To→  |Reference      |Owned
-------------|---------------|----------------------------
**Reference**|`AsRef`/`AsMut`|`ToOwned`
**Owned**    |`Borrow`(`Mut`)|(perhaps `Copy` or `Clone`?)

For an example where this applies, look no further than my earlier
[detective story about `std::borrow::Cow`](/2015/07/09/cow.html).

Should you decide to implement `Borrow` and/or `BorrowMut`, you need to ensure
that the result of `borrow()` has the same hash value as the borrowed original
value, lest your program fail in strange and confusing ways.

In fact, unless your type does something interesting with ownership (like 
`Cow` or [`owning_ref`](https://github.com/Kimundi/owning-ref-rs)), you should
probably leave `Borrow`, `BorrowMut` and `ToOwned` alone and use a `Cow` if
you want to abstract over owned/borrowed values.

I have not yet divined in what cases `AsRef`/`AsMut` may be useful unless you 
count the predefined `impl`s that `std` already provides.

### Send and Sync

Those two traits testify that the types transfer trouble-free 'tween threads.

You will never need to implement them – in fact Rust will do it for you by
default unless you explicitly opt out (or your type contains a non-threadsafe 
part). You can opt out by saying:

```Rust
impl !Send for MyType {} // this type cannot be sent to other threads
impl !Sync for MyType {} // nor can it be used by two of them
```

Note that this is currently not possible in stable Rust (which means that only
`std` gets to pull this trick).

[`Send`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html) says that you can 
*move* your type between thread barriers, while 
[`Sync`](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html) allows *sharing* 
a value between threads. Let's take a step back and look at what that means, 
probably best with an example.

Say we have some problem that we intend to solve by calculating some values in
parallel (because concurrency is the way, baby!). For that we need some
immutable data that will be the same in all threads – we want *shared* data.
This data needs to be `Sync`able.

Next, we want to give some part of the problem to each thread. To do this, we
need to `Send` it to them. But wait! How do we get the shared data to each
thread? Easy: We `Send` a reference to it – this works because of the following
blanket definition in the standard library:

```Rust
impl<'a, T> Send for &'a T where T: Sync + ?Sized
```

This means if something can be `Sync`ed, you can `Send` a reference to it 
between threads. Cool.

For a more thorough treatment, see Manish Goregaokar's 
[How Rust Achieves Thread Safety](http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/30/how-rust-achieves-thread-safety/)
or the [`Sync` docs](http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html).
